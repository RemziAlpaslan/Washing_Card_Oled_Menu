# Milking System Wash Control Panel - OLED Menu Interface
This project is a control interface developed for the washing unit of milking systems. The system is built using an ESP32 microcontroller, an OLED display, and a rotary encoder. The interface allows users to navigate through the menu and change settings easily by pressing and rotating the encoder.

# Features
OLED Display Menu: Visual interface to display settings and options.

Rotary Encoder Navigation:

Rotate to navigate through menu items.

Press to select or modify settings.

Interrupt-based Encoder Handling:

The rotary encoder is connected to the ESP32 using hardware interrupts for fast and accurate input detection.

ESP32 Platform:

Reliable and powerful microcontroller to handle display updates and user inputs efficiently.

## Hardware Used
ESP32 Development Board

0.96" OLED Display (I2C)

Rotary Encoder with Push Button

## Project Overview
The menu system enables users to:

Browse different washing modes and parameters.

Adjust washing settings easily in the field.

Ensure better control and maintenance of the milking system cleaning process.

The encoder's button click and rotation are used for intuitive navigation, improving the user experience significantly.
